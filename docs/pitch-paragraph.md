**Pitch:** 
We propose a novel tungsten-based candidate alloy, Material A+, combining V alloying with La2O3 and Y2O3 oxide dispersions and a minor ZrC carbide to simultaneously target ductility (DBTT reduction), swelling control, and reduced activation. Parametric trend estimates show directional improvements compared to baseline W alloys. This repository provides reproducible templates (FISPACT-II & TMAP7 inputs) so experimental groups can directly run activation and tritium retention studies and decide whether to fabricate and irradiate samples. High-risk / high-reward: if validated, Material A+ could materially reduce component replacement frequency and tritium management costs in fusion devices.
