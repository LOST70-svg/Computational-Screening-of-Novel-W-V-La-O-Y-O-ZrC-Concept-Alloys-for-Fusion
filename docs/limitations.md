# Limitations & Scientific Disclaimer

- All numerical values produced by `material_A+_physics_model.py` are parametric trend estimates only.
- Activation & contact dose results must be produced with FISPACT-II using an accurate neutron spectrum and geometry.
- Tritium retention must be produced with TMAP7 using trap parameters from experiments or literature.
- Swelling and mechanical degradation must be calibrated with irradiation experiments or cluster-dynamics simulations.

Publishing or proposing experimental campaigns based on these trends is appropriate, but presenting results as validated without the above tools and experimental data is scientifically inappropriate.
